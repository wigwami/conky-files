# My Conky Window
## ...and notes to make it your own

This repository contains the files used to draw the Conky window on my laptop's monitor.  

- A standard .conkyrc file creates the window and also the text elements within it. 
- The accompanying Lua script draws a radial gradient behind the window to help separate the text from the background wallpaper.

## Documentation 

The included PDF describes the contents of both files and includes notes on how you can modify this Conky window to your liking.  This documentation also exists as a GitBook page. 

This documentation follows the DITA standard. I used the open-source XML Copy Editor to create the individual topics and the DITA OT engine to generate the PDF and markdown outputs. The PDF output is available here, and the markdown files exist in a separate repository that automatically links to GitBook.
